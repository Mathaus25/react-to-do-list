# react-to-do-list

React application made as a personal project, to learn React, React Hooks, and more.

It was a really fun application to make, the list does not update, delete itself after refreshing the page using useEffect, the items storing locally.

Starting the application: 

1. npm install

2. npm run dev ( as it is created with Vite + React )
